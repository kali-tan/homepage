                    i have always been called empathetic. i know its stupid to call yourself an empath but i do think i have a really deep understanding of how other people feel and why other people do the things they do or feel the way they feel. i'm not perfect. sometimes i spend too much time trying to understand someone else when they don't understand me or it gets in the way of establishing how i feel. it's a beautiful thing to be empathetic, i think everyone wants to be understood and empathy is a step towards understanding another person or is the key to understanding. we are all human and though we have different experiences we all feel a huge range of emotions that we can recognizze in each other. i love knowing how happy my friends are and i love being able to understand when they are upset and why, so i can help them and be there for them. it's hard to help someone if you don't understand.

                    See the naked heart and spirit,<br>

                    “The rose is a rose, <br>
                    And was always a rose.<br>
                    But the theory now goes<br>
                    That the apple’s a rose,<br>
                    And the pear is, and so’s <br>
                    The plum, I suppose. <br>
                    The dear only knows<br>
                    What will next prove a rose.<br>
                    You, of course, are a rose-<br>
                    But were always a rose.”<br>
