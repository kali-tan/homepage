                    Hope drives. It takes the wheel and drives. It can drive people to do amazing and crazy things. I think hope is just as powerful as some people believe karma to be. Some external force is fueling hope. The strength hope provides is just too unexplainable. Hope is also such a simple concept for such a powerful thing. Just believe. Just know. The confidence. The trust. The hope that things will get better, the hope that things will change. It keeps people alive, it is everyone’s reason to live. That sounds so strong, but I genuinely believe hope gets everyone through conflicts. No one would find conflict worth it if they didn’t have hope they would come out the other side. Unless they’re crazy. I think they might have more hope then.

                    to put hope <br>
                    on your path of darkness<br>

                    For the branches to bloom,<br>
                    For the sky to pivot.<br>
                    These winter hours have stretched<br>
                    Longer than a season<br>
                    But I will wait. I will wait.”<br>
