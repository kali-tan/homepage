                    I think being enraged is so powerful. So incredibly driving. I always think about female rage, and I think I felt most enraged when thinking about the plight of being female. Do not get me wrong, I love being a woman but god damn is it unfair. That I am scared to have daughters, afraid of them being hurt but also afraid to have sons, in case they are the ones doing the hurting. Anger is also terrifying. It comes out in the way my dad drives the car really fast and recklessly, the way he hit the tables when yelling, the echoes of his voice out in public. That sounds really bad but I promise he is like fine he just has a lot of bottled emotion and it comes out quite loudly. As for anger,  it is everywhere. I have seen being angry or being enraged change someone. I think it makes you do things you never would have done otherwise. Good and bad. Mostly bad in my experience, but I have seen it be good. Be enraged that nothing is right so you can change it.

                    “If you saw a lion<br>
                    Not within a cage, <br>
                    Would you tease and fret him<br>
                    Till he roared in rage?<br>
                    Would you tempt his anger<br>
                    And his savage power, <br>
                    Knowing he could crush you,<br>
                    Kill you, and devour?<br>
                    Yet, I know some people<br>
                    Who, morn and noon and night,<br>
                    Tease and fret with bitters<br>
                    The lion-appetite.<br>
                    It matters not what ails them, <br>
                    For each disease and all<br>
                    They seem to think there’s healing <br>
                    In demon alcohol. <br>
                    So they fret the lion,<br>
                    And anger him, until, <br>
                    In his awful power,<br>
                    He springs up to kill. <br>
                    Let me warn you, children, <br>
                    From this foolish way. <br>
                    Do not tease the lion, <br>
                    Nor tempt him any day. <br>
                    Don’t believe the doctors<br>
                    If they say you need<br>
                    Any wines or ciders;<br>
                    For there are, indeed,<br>
                    Better cures, and safer, <br>
                    Than these drinks, that slay<br>
                    More than a hundred people<br>
                    Without fail each day. <br>

                    “Be not swift to take offense;<br>
                    Let it pass!<br>
                    Anger is a foe to sense;<br>
                    Let it pass!<br>
                    Brood not darkly o’er a wrong <br>
                    Which will disappear erelong;<br>
                    Bather sing this cheery song-<br>
                    Let it pass!<br>
                    <br>
                    Strife corrodes the purest mind;<br>
                    Let it pass! <br>
                    As the unregarded wind, <br>
                    Let it pass!<br>
                    Any vulgar souls that live<br>
                    May condemn without reprieve; <br>
                    ‘Tis the noble who forgive;<br>
                    Let is pass!<br>
                    <br>
                    Echo not an angry word; <br>
                    Let is pass!<br>
                    Think how often you have erred;<br>
                    Let it pass!<br>
                    Since our joys must pass away, <br>
                    Like the dew drops on the spray,<br>
                    Wherefore should our sorrows stay?<br>
                    Let it pass!”<br>
                    Let it Pass<br>

                    “What hast thou seen, O wind,<br>
                    Of beauty or of terror <br>
                    Surpassing, denied to us,<br>
                    That with precipitate wings,<br>
                    Mad and ecstatical, <br>
                    Thou spurnest the hollows and trees <br>
                    That offer thee refuge of peace,<br>
                    And findest within the sky<br>
                    No safety nor respite<br>
                    From the memory of thy vision?”<br>
