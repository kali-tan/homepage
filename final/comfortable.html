                    Comfortability is a thin line. You can be comfortable enough to be yourself and vulnerable, and feel safe, but in relationships, being comfortable can cause a lack of effort and an increase in apathy. People stop trying. It’s sad really. Wouldn’t you want to keep doing those things, especially if you find peace in the comfort someone gives you? I think comfort can encourage complacency. Complacency is different than affirmation. You don’t always have to be moving, but you cannot decide to stop and never go up. As a person I believe. Why never try new things? Why never grow? Why stop?

                    “Because I know who I am, I’m at ease and free. I can’t be like others, And they can’t be like me. I’ve got fading scars, An unusual physique, But it all works together, To make me unique. I’ve got hidden strengths, Some obvious flaws, Still I am who I am, For better, for worse. I don’t have to blend in; I won’t live a lie. I can’t please everyone; I won’t even try. Some call me proud; Others stare at me in alarm. But I’m not one to bother, Because I know who I am.”<br>

                    Thrown into your trajectory as you reach out<br>
                    For prizes and handsome dividends which harriers <br>
                    Can’t stop or delay without a single doubt.<br>
                    <br>
                    Within the comfort of your own skin, saunter forward<br>
