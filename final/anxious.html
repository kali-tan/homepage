                    Anxiety anxiety anxiety. I have a hard time hearing people whisper. My skin crawls. What if it’s about me? It used to be really bad. I used to shut down completely and I would start… hearing things that in hindsight, I realize you only hear what you want to hear. I know anxiety is not something we can really control the coming of, at least not for me. I’ve gotten really good recently but sometimes my skin crawls in the same way it used to when I was sixteen. It makes me feel so weak. But apathy is starting to take over, in a strong willed I am who I am way. Proud of myself. Anxiety makes my breathing slow. Well, I actually think it makes it fast but then I am aware and slow it significantly. I am very.. aware of myself.

                    “When I set out to find my father, I was not being brave. <br>
                    I was acting out of fear of losing the only parent I ever had. <br>
                    They may want you to believe I was simply being brave, <br>
                    But anxiety makes more heroes than history would care to repeat.”<br>

                    “My fear of being real, of being seen, paralyzes me into silence. I crave the touch and the connection, but I’m not always brave enough to open my hand and reach out. This is the great challenge: to be seen, accepted, and loved, I must first reveal, offer, and surrender.”<br>

                    “Do not romanticize <br>
                    the bruises beneath my eyes. <br>
                    Do not compare them<br>
                    to fields of lilacs <br>
                    ready to be plucked. <br>
                    I’m just tired. <br>
                    I’m just so goddamn tired. <br>
                    And there’s nothing beautiful<br>
                    about that. “<br>

                    “It’s funny. I still feel like a little girl. I’m still looking around to check and see what other people are doing to make sure I’m not completely different; I’m still looking around for help, hoping for a quick nudge and a whisper of advice. But I can’t seem to be able to catch anybody’s eye. Nobody else around me seems to be looking around and wondering what to do. Why is it that I feel like I’m the only person who is confused and concerned about the choices I’ve made and where I’m headed?”<br>

                    “there are maple trees, one, two, three<br>
                    but wait there’s 5 more, 2 behind the bungalow<br>
                    and lots in the poetry state forest<br>
                    I hear target practice from far away, it’s<br>
                    probably for shooting deer, bears and dinosaurs<br>
                    but how will we, still alive, socialize<br>
                    in the winter? wrapped in bear skins<br>
                    we’ll sit around pot-bellied stoves eating<br>
                    the lobelias of fear leftover from desperation<br>
                    last summer’s woodland sunflowers and bee balm<br>
                    remind us of black cherry eaten in a hurry<br>
                    while the yard grows in the moonlight<br>
                    shrinking like a salary or a damaged item<br>
                    when we return in the morning for a breakfast<br>
                    of harvest petunias sprinkled with wild marsh mallow”<br>
