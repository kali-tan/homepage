                    Hm. I wouldn’t say I’ve ever grieved anyone. The only family member whose death has mildly affected me is my great grandma. She died when I was away at school. I never got to say bye. Not that she would know who I was, she had a stroke when I was eight and never recovered, paralyzed on her left side for the rest of her life. I miss her though, she raised me when my parents couldn’t. Pictures are bittersweet. So are memories. I have this really big fear of losing my family or not being able to be there when someone dies. I live so far away. I don’t think I could pause my life and go back however many miles back home. Grief is intense. Someone close to me lost their father recently. I can see the way it affects him even now, years later. The guilt, the memories, the missing. I wonder how he would be if his dad never died. Probably happier. Different. I have grieved relationships. Grieved what could have been. The what ifs. A dangerous path.

                    “I sat with my anger long enough until she told me her real name was grief.” <br>
                    C.S Lewis 
                    <br><br>

                    “She didn’t sob or wail. Her grief was horribly discreet but as persistent and almost as silent as bleeding from an unstitched wound.”<br>
                    Patrick Gale
                    <br><br>

                    “Now I have to<br>
                    remember you<br>
                    for longer than I <br>
                    have known you.”<br>
                    c.c.aurel 
                    <br><br>

                    “One of the hardest things you will ever have to do, my dear, is to grieve the loss of a person who is still alive.” 
                    <br><br>

                    “Grief, I’ve learned, is really just love. It’s all the love you want to give, but cannot. All that unspent love gathers up in the corners of your eyes, the lump in your throat, and in that hollow part of your chest. Grief is just love with no place to go.”<br>
                    Jamie Anderson 
                    <br><br>

                    “I don’t want to have to be the one who mourns everything when everyone else has clearly forgotten. It’s mortifying. It’s mortifying to be the one who remembers.”<br>
                    Ryan O’Connell 
                    <br><br>

                    “For it’s our grief that gives us our gratitude, Shows us how to find hope, if we ever lose it. So ensure that this ache wasn’t endured in vain: Do not ignore the pain. Give it purpose. Use it. Read children’s books, dance alone to DJ music. Know that this distance will make our hearts grow fonder. From a wave of woes our world will emerge stronger.”<br>
                    Amanda Gorman, The Miracle of Morning 
                    <br><br>
