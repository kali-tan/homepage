        <h2>Different Types of Cards</h2>
        <p>In a Pokémon card pack, there are a few different types of cards. Much like a regular deck, they have different properties and different uses. Let's go through the types: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Pokémon Cards</li>
                <p> These cards are the little Pocket monsters that help you win the game. Different types of Pokémon Energy cards are used to power up their moves. Each card has its own information, with the Pokémon's moves, type, and stats.</p>
            <li>Trainer Cards</li>
                <p>Trainer cards are basically support cards, with a myraid of different effects, dependng on the card itself. The instructions of the card/properties of the card will be written on the card itself.</p>
            <li>Energy Cards</li>
                <p> Energy cards are cards used to power up Pokémon, and come in all the different types. Each card is able to power up the respective Pokémon type's moves.</p>
        </ul>
