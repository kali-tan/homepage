        <h1>The Pokémon Type Chart</h1>
        <a href="index.html">Back Home</a>
        <p>Pokémon come in a couple different types. A type is a category that defines the element their moves utilize, and is used to measure how effective those skills are against other Pokémon. For example, a water type Pokémon would have moves such as <em>Water Gun</em>, or <em>Whirlpool</em>, while a fire type Pokémon would have moves like <em>Flamethrower</em> or <em>Fire Spin</em>. Pokémon can also have up to two types, makig them dual-type Pokémon, but moves can only be one type. Most if not all dual-type Pokémon's types correspond with each other. Some Pokémon have dual types with two types that don't go together, such as water/electric or grass.flying types. Pokémon can also gain a different type upon evolution. Overall, there are now 18 total official types of Pokémon.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Normal</li>
            <li>Fire</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Grass</li>
            <li>Electric</li>
            <li>Ice</li>
            <li>Fighting</li>
            <li>Poison</li>
            <li>Ground</li>
            <li>Flying</li>
            <li>Psychic</li>
            <li>Bug</li>
            <li>Rock</li>
            <li>Ghost</li>
            <li>Dragon</li>
            <li>Dark</li>
            <li>Steel</li>
            <li>Fairy</li>

        </ul>
        <p>As mentioned previously, each type has its own strengths and weaknesses, most of which follow a logical setup. For example, fire type Pokémon are weak against water type Pokémon, ice type Pokémon are weak against fire type Pokémon, water type Pokémon are weak against electirc type Pokémon, and so forth. Included below is a type chart matchup for Pokémon.</p>
