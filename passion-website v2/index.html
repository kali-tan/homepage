            <h1>The World of Pokémon</h1>
            <h2>What are Pokémon?</h2>
                <p>Pokémon is a Japanese media franchise, consisting of video games, animated series and films, a trading card game, and other related media. But Pokémon themselves are mysterious creatures/monsters, living in the Pokémon universe, and can be captured or trained to battle other monsters in a trainer's quest to become the best. Essentially, they are akin to animals, though each with different skills, moves, and even types. Some Pokémon can also evolve, and they live in all different regions in the Pokémon universe.</p>
