        <h1>Kalissa's Homepage</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Kalissa. My pronouns are she/her, I'm from Chicago, <em>really Naperville but who knows where that is right</em>? I am a graphic-design major, in her junior year! I have no clue what I'm doing yet but I'm taking this Web Design class at an attempt to learn how to design websites as a skill for the future. These are my websites.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="first-website/index.html">first website</a></li>
            <li><a href="passion-website/index.html">passion part 1</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here are my journals for this class! Please access this page to view all of them. Thanks!</p>
